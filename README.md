# accounting_system
This is a basic accounting TYPO3 extension

## Installation
``cd path to your TYPO3 extensions ...typo3conf/ext``

``git clone git@github.com:FiacreGH/accounting_system.git``

As it is not a composer mode EXT, run ``composer dumpautoload`` to load it classes

Now you can use it plugin in a page

Notice that the plugin on that page should be protected by a [frontend login](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/EditorsTutorial/AccessControl/Login/Index.html)
